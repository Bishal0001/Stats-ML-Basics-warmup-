#To find the probability that the variable has a value LESS than or equal
#let's say 113, you'd use CDF cumulative Density Function
scipy.stats.norm.cdf(113,100,12)
Output: 0.86066975255037792
#or 86.07% probability

#To find the probability that the variable has a value GREATER than or
#equal to let's say 125, you'd use SF Survival Function 
scipy.stats.norm.sf(125,100,12)
Output: 0.018610425189886332
#or 1.86%

#To find the variate for which the probability is given, let's say the 
#value which needed to provide a 98% probability, you'd use the 
#PPF Percent Point Function
scipy.stats.norm.ppf(.98,100,12)
Output: 124.64498692758187
