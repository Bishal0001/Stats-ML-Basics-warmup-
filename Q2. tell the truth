'''Description : The probabilities that “A” and “B” will tell the truth are 2/3 and 4/5 respectively. What is the probability that

i) they agree with each other

ii) they contradict each other while giving a witness in the court. '''


''' SOL 1'''

Probability of A telling truth => Pa = 2/3
Probability of B telling truth => Pb = 4/5

i)they agree with each other is equal to both speaking truth or both speaking false
Pa Agree b = (Pa * Pb) + ((1-Pa) * (1-Pb)) = 0.6

ii) they contradict each other while giving a witness in the court means one of them tells
the truth other does not agree.
PaContradictb = (Pa * (1-Pb)) + ((1-Pa)*Pb) = 0.4
