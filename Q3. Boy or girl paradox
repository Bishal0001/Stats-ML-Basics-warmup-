''' Question : Supposedly a friend of yours has 2 children and at least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that the other is also a boy? '''

'''Explanation : If at least one is a boy, there are three possible equally likely gender assignations of two siblings. boy-boy, boy-girl,
or girl-boy. Only 1 in 3 cases or 33 percent are both boys. The lesson here is that when considering equally likely scenarios
we must consider birth order. If the birth order of the boy is not specified – i.e. if we don’t know if he is the eldest or
the youngest – the probability of two boys drops to 1 in 3. '''
