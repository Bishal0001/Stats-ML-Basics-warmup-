- Create a function dotProduct to calculate the dot product of v1 and v2
- Create a function magnitude to calculate the mangnitude of a vector by
- calculating the square root of its dot product with itself.
- Create a function to calculate the angle between the two vectors,
- In order to perform their dot product, first check if their lengths are equal
- Calculate the angle between them by calculating the arc cosine of their dot product divided by the product of their mangnitude.
